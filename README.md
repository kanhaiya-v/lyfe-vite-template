# Lyfe Vite Template

A modern Vite template featuring a hybrid architecture that combines feature-based organization with component-driven development enabling scalable development and modular organization. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a curated set of powerful tools.

```

### Architecture Overview

- **Feature Folders**: Each feature encapsulates its own `components/`, `api.ts`, `hooks/`, and `store.ts`
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components in `components/` are available across features
- **Global Providers**: App-wide providers (ReactQueryProvider, ZustandStoreProvider) wrap the application
- **Routing**: React Router for declarative routing with route guards and lazy loading

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡️ Vite for lightning-fast development
- 🔥 React 19 with TypeScript
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- 📦 PNPM as package manager
- 🎯 ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- 🔄 React Query for data fetching
- 🎭 Radix UI primitives
- 🎮 State management with Zustand
- 🛣️ React Router for routing
- 🚀 Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Using the Template

```bash
# Create a new project using the template
pnpm dlx lyfe init <project-name>

# Navigate to project directory
cd <project-name>

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <clone url>
cd <repo>

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## 🧱 Code Guidelines

### Feature Organization
- Keep feature-specific logic inside respective `features/` folders
- Each feature should be self-contained with its own components, API calls, and state management
- Use `lib/` for shared utilities and constants

### Component Development
- All UI components should be reusable and responsive
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - kebab-case for files
  - PascalCase for components
- Use shadcn/ui components as building blocks
- Use `pnpm lyfe add <component/template-name>` for additional components or template built as shareable.

### State Management (Zustand)
- Lightweight, scalable state management per feature
- Feature-specific stores live in `features/<feature>/store.ts`
- Global state managed through providers in `store/`

### API Handling (React Query)
- All API calls use `@tanstack/react-query`
- Query setup provided in `ReactQueryProvider`
- API logic co-located in feature folders (`features/<feature>/api.ts`)

### Routing (React Router)
- Route definitions in `routes/` directory
- Implement route guards for protected routes
- Use lazy loading for route components
- Keep route-specific components in feature folders

### UI System
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui for accessible, reusable components
- Extensible through Tailwind configuration
